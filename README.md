# energy-consumption-and-cost-tracking
## Objective
To monitor and analyze energy usage and costs across various departments, buildings, or energy sources, enabling organizations to reduce waste, control costs, and improve sustainability.

## Key Steps in Implementation
### 1 Data Sources
  - Smart Meters: Measure energy usage in real-time.
  - Energy Management Systems: Track energy consumption trends and peak demand.
  - Billing Systems: Monitor energy costs and identify potential savings.
### 2 Metrics
 - Energy consumption and peak demand.
 - Cost savings and cost per unit of energy.
 - Carbon footprint and sustainability progress.
### 3 Visualizations
#### 1.	Energy Usage Visualization
  - Dashboards: Display trends in energy consumption, peak usage times, and cost per unit of energy.
#### 2.	Cost vs. Consumption Analysis
  - Stacked Bar Charts: Compare energy costs with consumption levels to identify inefficiencies.
#### 3.	Sustainability Reporting
 - Progress Tracking: Visualize progress toward sustainability goals, including carbon emissions reduction.
