# energy-consumption-and-cost-tracking
## Objective
To monitor and analyze energy usage and costs across various departments, buildings, or energy sources, enabling organizations to reduce waste, control costs, and improve sustainability.

## Key Steps in Implementation
### 1. Data Sources
  - Smart Meters: Measure energy usage in real-time.
  - Energy Management Systems: Track energy consumption trends and peak demand.
  - Billing Systems: Monitor energy costs and identify potential savings.
### 2. Metrics
 - Energy consumption and peak demand.
 - Cost savings and cost per unit of energy.
 - Carbon footprint and sustainability progress.
   
### 3. Power BI Features Utilized
Leverage Power BI to create insightful and actionable dashboards:

#### 1. Energy Usage Visualization:
 - Create dashboards showing energy consumption trends, cost per unit of energy, and peak usage times.
#### 2. Cost vs. Consumption:
  - Stacked Bar Charts: Compare energy costs with consumption levels to detect inefficiencies and outliers.
#### 3. Sustainability Reporting:
 - Gauge Charts: Monitor progress toward reducing carbon emissions or energy waste.
 - KPIs: Display real-time performance against sustainability targets.

## Actionable Insights
The Power BI dashboards provide insights that enable informed decision-making:

#### 1. Reduce Energy Waste:
Identify inefficiencies by analyzing high-consumption periods and locations.
#### 2. Optimize Energy Usage:
Adjust operational schedules to reduce peak demand and costs.
#### 3. Achieve Sustainability Goals:
Track progress toward reducing the carbon footprint and improving energy efficiency.
